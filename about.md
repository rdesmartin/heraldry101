When I started learning about heraldry, I found a lot of very good guides that teach the basics for absolute beginners: its origins, the specific vocabulary, the rule of tincture, etc. [Simple Heraldry, Cheerfully Illustrated](https://archive.org/details/simpleheraldrych0000donp) is a great example.

Once I learned the basics, like many heraldry enthusiasts, I was eager to create my coat of arms, and I found suprisingly few guides on how to *create good heraldry*. At first, I fell for many common beginners mistakes. After a lot of research, redesigns trial and error, I finally landed on a design that I was happy with. With this guide, I hope to help other beginners to learn from my mistakes.

I am not claiming to be an expert in either heraldry or design. All the advice given here is either based on some of the mistakes I committed or witnessed, as a way for budding heraldists to learn from them; or they are an expression of my personal opinions and tastes.
