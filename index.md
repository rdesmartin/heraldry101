# Welcome to Heraldry 101

In addition to being a respectable science studied by historians and genealogists, heraldry can be a fun hobby about drawing cool shields. Part of the fun -- and the beauty -- of it comes from its set of simple rules that one should follow to create striking heraldic designs. However, these rules are not always easy to understand and to put into practice: some are unspoken, some contradict each others, some are specific to a country, and most have countless exceptions...

This guide's goal is to help you navigate the rules of heraldry to start creating your own coat of arms. I wrote it for people who already have a basic knowledge of heraldry, and want to go deeper into heraldic design.
