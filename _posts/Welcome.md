This guide's goal is to help you start creating your coat of arms. I wrote it for people who already started to learn about heraldry, and want to start creating good heraldry for themselves or for fun.

When I started learning about heraldry, I found a lot of very good guides that teach the basics: its origins, the specific vocabulary, the rule of tincture, etc. Simple Heraldry, Cheerfully Illustrated is a very good example.

But once I learned the basics, I was eager to create my coat of arms, and I found suprisingly few guides on how to create *good heraldry*. At first, I fell into many of the common pitfalls that beginners fall for. After many research and trial and error, I finally landed on a design that I was happy with.

Since then, I learned more about the topic and even helped some people to design their arms. I noticed that a lot of beginners go through the same errors as I did; most of these errors come from the inaccurate representations of heraldry in modern pop-culture. 

This guide aims to help beginners go past this stage as fast as possible and get started designing good heraldry. 

I am not claiming to be an expert in either heraldry or design. All the advice given here is either based on some of the mistakes I committed or witnessed, as a way for budding heraldists to learn from them; or they are an expression of my personal opinions and tastes.
