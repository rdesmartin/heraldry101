Universities coat of arms is one of the great contemporary uses of heraldry: when a school uses a coat of arms, it gives a symbol that all the students can identify to and it creates feeling of belonging. Which is why I always found it a shame that French universities are not using coats of arms. Many universities [did have a coat of arms](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Academic_coats_of_arms_of_France), but they fell into disuse after the Revolution. Nowadays, they French universities mostly use contemporary graphic design-y identities, which are very soul-less. The university of Strasbourg doesn't even have a logo, but uses a logotype with a custom font. Is there a historical coat of arms it could reclaim? There are some coats of arms associated with the university, but whether they were actually used is a bit more complicated.

The university started as the Gymnasium, created by Jean Sturm in 1538 and was raised to the rank of Academie in 1566, it was then granted the rank of University in 1621.

The earliest heraldry associated with the University is on the university's Greater Sceptre. It is a ceremonial mace that has been carried in graduation ceremony since 1621. On its head, the greater scepter shows the coat of arms of the city of Strasbourg, and a coat for the university. The university's arms reuse the emblem of the Academie: a Christ resurected, over an inescutcheon with the arms of the city. There are no indications of tincture here.

The mace also shows the coats of arms of several of Strasbourg's burgers, who were officers of the university at the time of the foundation: 
* Wolff Sigismund Wurmser, chancellor
* Johann Carle Lorcher
* Fridrich von Gottesheim
* Adam Zorn von Plobsheim, chancellor
* Peter Storck
* Frantz Rudolf Ingold

We also know the seals of the university and its faculties at the time of its foundation: 
* The university's seal shows a Christ resurected over the arms of the city
* The faculty of theology shows a Christ resurected triumphing over sin (represented by a snake) and death (a skeleton)
* The faculty of law shows an allegory of law, a woman crowned, holding in her dexter hand a sword and in the senester one a scale, between two closed books.
* The faculty of medicine shows a woman with winged feet standing on a whell between two columns, each wrapped with a scroll, the dexter one reading "DOGOS", and the sinister one "PEIRA". On top of the columns, two olive branches, and at the top of the seal, an inescutcheon with the arms of Strasbourg.
* The faculty of philosophy shows Athena in armour, holding a lance and the Aegis, standing beween a book and an owl

To me, it seems like the university's arms that appear on the shield are a the emblem taken from the seal rather than proper arms. The fact that the arms of the city appear is an evidence of that. I would like to find the edict of the university's foundation by the Holy Roman Emperor to see if there is any mention of attributing arms to the university in it.

The earliest proper reference to the university's arms are in grants of arms given by Charles d'Hozier. He was an officer of Louis XIV, tasked with recording all arms in the kingdom of France in order to impose a tax on all instutions and persons who had a coat of arms (in 1681, the university of Strasbourg became part of France, along with the city).

The arms he records for the university and its faculties are based on the seals:

University of Strasbourg: "Azure, a Christ carnation, vested with a loincloth argent and a mantle or, his dexter hand raised, and holding in his senestre hand a long cross from which hangs a flag argent charged with a cross gules". Note that the arms of the city do not appear

For the faculties, I did not find the actual blason, but here is my attempt at blasoning them from the achievements in d'Hoziers armorial:
* faculty of theology: Gules, a Christ carnation vested of a cloak and loincloth argent, his dexter hand raised, his senestre hand holding a cross-staff or from which hangs a banner argent charged with a cross gules, standing over a snake or intertwined with a skeleton argent. 
* faculty of medicine: Azure, a woman carnation with her arms raised, standing on a wheel or, between two columns wrapped in scrolls or, on top of each an olive branch embowed towards chief point; in chief point, an inescutcheon argent charged with a bend gules (of Strasbourg)
* faculty of law: azure, a woman dressed or holding in her dexter hand scales argent and in her sinister hand a sword argent, above two books or.
* Faculty of philosophy: Azure, on a champagne or, Athena holding a lance and the Aegis between a book in dexter and an owl in sinister. 

However, I don't think these arms were actually claimed by the university or the faculties. The reason is this: d'Hozier is well-known for making up arms for people or institutions, just so that he could squeeze money from them. You can clearly see that the arms he recorded for the university are copies of their seals with basic tinctures added to them. All in all they are pretty poor arms, and to me it is because they are not real arms at all.

In addition, I couldn't find any uses of these arms in any document from the university (but of course I'm ready to change my opinion if someone can show me instances where they were).

All in all, I don't think there are historical arms that the university could use today, because the historical arms are a poor adaptation from a seal, that might have not been ever used by the university as such. Moreover, the religious connotation wouldn't sit well with the current French academic culture.

One potential alternative is to make arms from the arms of the founding chancelors, like it's been done by some Oxbridge colleges. This would create a sense of continuity with both heraldic tradition and the university's history. It is also convenient that one of the founders bears a Stork, one of Alsace's symbols.

Another alternative would be to design a completely new coat of arms for the university. That sounds like a fun exercise, and I might update this blog soon with a proposition of my own.
