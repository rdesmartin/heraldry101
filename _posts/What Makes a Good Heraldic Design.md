# Tradition
The rules of heraldry are here to help create a good design.
Contrasting colors (rue of tincture), simple shapes and patterns, symmetry, repetition.
There is also a tradition of complex charges, quarters, augmentation and differenciation, etc. but imo this strays from the first goal of heraldry and the quality that has made it exist until today. 
# Cohesion
In good designs, elements (shapes, colors, patterns) fit well together. 
Can be achieved through symmetry, contrast (counter-changing, long v. short, round v. square, geometric v. organic shapes, etc.), simplicity of a design (only one charge, only 2-3 colors, etc.)
# Uniqueness
Unique features make a striking design.
Uncommon elements: innovation, or using a rare traditional charge
Unique combination of ordinaries
# Meaning
Arms with a clever or deep personal meaning are good. 
Clever canting arms
Deep meaning of the charges, obscure reference
Of course, people change and it is possible to assign a new meaning to elements of one's arms, so don't fret too much about it.
