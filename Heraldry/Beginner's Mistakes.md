# False Quartering
Using a shield divided in four parts with one symbol in each quarter is a common design for beginners. It's easy to understand why: many of the heraldry we are commonly exposed to (e.g. UK arms, royalty arms) have this quartered design. But it is usually reserved for when several entities with existing arms are combined, and it usually follow some rules. It is known as false quartering, and it is best avoided. 

It is much nicer to find a way to unify all the different symbolisms in a nice [[What Makes a Good Heraldic Design?#Cohesion|cohesive design]].

# Excessive National Symbols
Beginners also tend to want to incorporate national symbols in their coat of arms; it is perfectly ok, but there are way more aspects to one's personnality to one's country of origins! Imagine if all French people used a fleur-de-lys, French coat of arms would be a bit boring. 

Of course there are tasteful ways of incorporating national symbols in one's arms, but it is more elegant to do it in a subtle way (Canadians with maple leaves, I'm looking at you!)

# Usurpation
A [[Common Heraldry Myths#Coats of Arms are shared by all those with the same surname|common misconception]] about heraldry is that all people with the same surname share the same coat of arms. In most cases, it is not the case. 

This is a sticky misconception, especially because it is actively maintained by sellers of novelty coat of arms. But it's so much more fun to design one's own arms!

# Very Common Symbols
Some symbols have been used so much that they are a bit cliche. It is perfectly fine to use them, but it is good to be aware of these and I think that most of the time, it is better to come up with alternatives.
## Books
Universities
## National Symbols
Double-headed eagle, Fleur de Lys, Bordure Fleury-counter fleury, etc.
## Lions
Lions are one of the most common Heraldic figures. "Qui ne porte rien porte un lion."

Again, nothing wrong about using them, but since one interest of heraldry is to be distinctive, it is good to know that these are commonly used. There are [[Things to Do When Designing One's Coat of Arms#Inspiration|many ways]] to come up with creative designs.
